# happy-fridge-app - WIP

HappyFridge addresses the gaps and issues of existing systems by offering an intuitive app that tracks perishable grocery items. This is achieved through reminders, smart recipe suggestions and social engagement. It will reduce food waste, promote sustainable choices, and encourage social interaction around food consumption.

## Architecture considerations
- MutableLiveData to dynamically update the UI as items are added or changed.
- ConstraintLayout for creating clean and responsive user interfaces.
- SQLite database to store fridge items persistently on the device.
- Navigation to switch between different screens such as item list, add/edit item, and expiring soon view.

## Little disclaimer
- We are using an enterprise GitHub at ITU, and therefore, it's not possible to fork the repo here - which is why there is no history, since I need to copy paste the files.
